Description
===========
An initial cut at the public facing API endpoints found at https://alpha.neur.io.  **Unsupported, hacked up, but still cool.**

Caveat
------
This is work that is **not endorsed nor supported by neurio**.  It is pre-alpha release and by using it you acknowledge these two facts!  But **have fun**!

Whats available?
----------------
This is a PCL compliant library (Microsofts Portabl Class Library) which does run with Xamarin (included) and should compile for Mono, all in C#.  It supports these undocumented and unsupported API endpoints:

* Login
* Get the Current User
* Listing of appliances
* Listing of Sensors
* Listing of locations
* Listing of sensor stats (live and samples)

The current client, built with the Xamarin toolchain, is meant to be a prototype/proof of concept.
